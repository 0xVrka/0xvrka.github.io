## About Me

I come from a background in digital forensics and CTFs, where I spent a lot of time analyzing logs and competing in national and international events.

Currently, my focus is on smart contract auditing, with specific interests in AMM protocols and DLT architecture. I use this blog to document my research, technical notes, and the things I learn while digging through the code.
